quote [13] = "\"The major problem—one of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.\"";

Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.\"";

Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection. \"Tricky,\" he said finally. \"But can you do it?\" Again, a significant pause. \"Yes,\" said Deep Thought, \"I can do it.\" \"There is an answer?\" said Fook with breathless excitement. \"Yes,\" said Deep Thought. \"Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But, I'll have to think about it.\" Ford glanced impatiently at his watch. \"How long?\" he said. \"Seven and a half million years.\" Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other. \"Seven and a half million years!\" they cried in chorus. \"Yes.\" said Deep Thought.";

Their waiting had not been in vain. \"There really is one?\" breathed Phouchg. \"There really is one,\" confirmed Deep Thought. \"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and everything?\" \"Yes.\" Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children. \"And you're ready to give it to us?\" urged Loonsuawl. \"I am.\" \"Now?\" \"Now,\" said Deep Thought. They both licked their dry lips. \"Though I don't think,\" added Deep Thought. \"that you're going to like it.\" \"Doesn't matter!\" said Phouchg. \"We must know it! Now!\" \"Now?\" inquired Deep Thought. \"Yes! Now...\" \"All right,\" said the computer, and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable. \"You're really not going to like it,\" observed Deep Thought. \"Tell us!\" \"All right,\" said Deep Thought. \"The Answer to the Great Question...\" \"Yes..!\" \"Of Life, the Universe and Everything...\" said Deep Thought. \"Yes...!\" \"Is...\" said Deep Thought, and paused. \"Yes...!\" \"Is...\" \"Yes...!!!...?\" \"Forty-two,\" said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.\"";

quote [40] = "\"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God. The argument goes something like this: \"I refuse to prove that I exist,'\" says God, \"for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.\" \"But,\" says Man, \"The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't.
