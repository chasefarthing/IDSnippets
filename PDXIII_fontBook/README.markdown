Need a Glyph overview?
==
use PDXIII_fontBook.jsx
==
This script makes a page for every character of a string.  
--
It uses "script labels"  
  
- Open the provided .idml.
- Open the Scriptlabel Window.
- Select a textframe.  
  
**There is a label in each frame.**  
**DONT CHANGE THEM!**  
  
- Enter some text in the source **frame**. Not in the label.
- copy&paste the target frames and change the styling.  
Then run the script.  
You will have as many pages as there are glyphs in the source frame text.  
  
The _"PDXIII\_fontBook\_standAlone.jsx"*_ version of the script builds a doc with some labeled frames.
Then it works like you executed the script.
